# Daily_DSA

A repository for daily Data Structures and Algorithms practice. Each problem is solved in C++ and organized neatly for revision and improvement.

## 📌 Purpose
- Build strong DSA fundamentals.
- Maintain consistency by solving one problem every day.
- Track progress and revisit previous challenges.
- Use this repository as a personal reference and portfolio.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder is named using the pattern:  
  **`<problem-number>-<problem-title>`**
- Each folder contains:
  - `main.cpp` (solution file)
  - Additional notes or explanation (optional)

Example:
```
121-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
│── main.cpp
```

## 🚀 How to Run
```
git clone https://github.com/Akrist3/Daily_DSA.git
cd Daily_DSA/<problem-folder>
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o run
./run
```

## 🧠 Learning Approach
- Try solving the problem yourself first.
- After solving, add comments explaining your approach.
- Revisit your solutions weekly or monthly.
- Identify patterns like:
  - Two Pointers
  - Sliding Window
  - Binary Search
  - Recursion & DP
  - Graph Techniques

## 📈 Goals
- Improve problem-solving ability.
- Prepare for coding interviews and exams.
- Build a strong coding habit.
- Create a structured DSA portfolio.
